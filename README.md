# Dumbwaiter

A simple command-line tool for recording HTTP requests.

## Installation

To install servant, ensure you have a recent version of Go installed and run
the command:

```bash
go get github.com/brett-lempereur/dumbwaiter
```

This will install the `servant` tool into your `GOPATH`.

## Usage

To run servant, ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` is in your path and run:

```bash
dumbwaiter -v --address=:8080 --status=201 output.json

This will launch a server on port 8080 that will respond to any request on any
path with a HTTP 201 status code, capture the body of the request in a file,
and echo the body to the screen.
